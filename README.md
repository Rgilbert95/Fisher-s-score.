# Fisher-s-score.
My implementation of Fisher’s score in R

In this exercise, 2 main functions have been implemented,
”mui” and ”fisher” respectively. In the first function ”mui”,
the mean of each respective feature is calculated. By using the
second function, the labels are stored as well as their respective
frequencies, after that, the mean and standard deviation
of the data points belonging to a label are calculated. Finally,
the fisher index is calculated.
The function has been tested using two gaussians that can be
appreciated as follows:
